  <li class="list-group-item">The knit stitch is the most basic stitch of the knitting process. Stitching is essentially the process by which you turn a ball of yarn into a length of knitted fabric. <br><br>1. With your cast-on needle in your left hand, insert your other knitting needle's point under the first stitch at the top of your cast-on needle.<br><br>2. Insert one of your knitting needles through the loop of your knot and pull the strands of yarn on either side to tighten. Make sure there is about one foot of yarn on the end that is not attached to your ball. You will use this length of yarn to cast on your stitches.<br><br>3. Casting on is the next step in setting up your knitting project. The amount of stitches you cast on for your project will determine its overall starting width. When making a scarf, for example, I usually cast on about 20 stitches.<br><br>4. With your knitting needle in your right hand, wrap a loop of yarn from your open strand around your left thumb.<br><br>5. Insert your knitting needle under the loop on your left thumb.<br><br>6. Pull a piece of the strand from the side attached to your ball of yarn over the top of your knitting needle.<br><br>7. With your left hand, lift the loop made by your left thumb over the piece of yarn you just placed over it. <br><br> 8. Pull your left-hand strand to tighten it. That is it! Repeat the last five steps for each stitch you want to cast on. When you are done, there will be a little bit of yarn hanging off the end of your needle. That is fine. You will be able to weave it through your design or cut it off at the end of your project.<br><br><br>Source: <a href ='http://www.designsponge.com/2013/01/how-to-knit-the-basics.html'>designsponge.com</a></li>
